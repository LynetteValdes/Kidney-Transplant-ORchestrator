# Kidney-Transplant-ORchestrator
This project proposes a way to use the data containing the incompatible matches and maximizing the number of compatible kidney transplants in the KPD program by matching as many size 2 and 3 optimal matchings.
Using various operations research (OR) tools and techniques, I will develop a mathematical model to solve this problem to maximize the number of kidney transplants, making sure that all of the exchanges are medically feasible by ensuring blood type compatibility and that each participant is only involved in one exchange.
